## DESCRIPTION ##
The test scripts were not built based on a set of specific test cases. They were designed to learn and to test specific aspects of the websites, giving ample scope to leverage the multiple features of Cypress.

Because Cypress can be used both HTML and Angular pages, we have taken into consideration both the websites and build the test scripts accordingly.

The framework has used the following tools for handling the many aspects of testing and reporting:
* Cypress
* GitHub
* Jenkins
* jQuery
* Cypress Dashboard
* WebStorm
* JavaScript
* Chai
* Mocha

The testing framework consists of 5 pages of a website. They are:

Angular Page Test I
Angular Page Test II
Automation Practice Page Test I
Automation Practice Page Test II
Home Page Test

The Angular Page and Automation Practice Page aspect of the different websites contain a lot of test information and hence, it was decided to split them into two different test scripts.

We will deep-dive into what the respective page files test below:

#### 1. Angular Page Test I ####
#### 2. Angular Page Test II ####
#### 3. Automation Practice Page Test I ####
#### 4. Automation Practice Page Test II ####
#### 5. Home Page Test ####
