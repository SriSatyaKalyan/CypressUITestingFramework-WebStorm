# CypressUITestingFramework-WebStorm # :egg:
---------------
:octocat: A Cypress testing framework which runs few tests which put to test different UI aspects of the following websites:
https://rahulshettyacademy.com/angularpractice/
https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/
http://www.qaclickacademy.com/

## DESCRIPTION ##
The test scripts were not built based on a set of specific test cases. They were designed to learn and to test specific aspects of the websites, giving ample scope to leverage the multiple features of Cypress.

Because Cypress can be used both HTML and Angular pages, we have taken into consideration both the websites and build the test scripts accordingly.

The framework has used the following tools for handling the many aspects of testing and reporting:
* Cypress
* GitHub
* Jenkins
* jQuery
* Cypress Dashboard
* WebStorm
* JavaScript
* Chai
* Mocha

The testing framework tests of 5 pages of different websites. They are:
1. AngularHomePage
2. AngularShoppingPage
3. Automation Practice Page Test I
4. Automation Practice Page Test II
5. Home Page Test

The Automation Practice Page aspect of the respective website contains a lot of test information and hence, it was decided to split it into two different test scripts.

We will deep-dive into what the respective page files test below:

#### 1. AngularHomePage ####
This complete test file consists of two tests on the https://rahulshettyacademy.com/angularpractice/ webpage which is referred to as the Angular Home Page
* ***Angular Home Page: Header***
This test script verifies if the header of the webpage consists of "ProtoCommerce", "Home" and "Shop" links
* ***Angular Home Page: Form***
This test script fills the form in the webpage with the required information and verifies if submitting the information throws an alert saying "Success"

#### 2. AngularShoppingPage ####
#### 3. Automation Practice Page Test I ####
#### 4. Automation Practice Page Test II ####
#### 5. Home Page Test ####
